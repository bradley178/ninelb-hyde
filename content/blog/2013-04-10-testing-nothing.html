{% mark excerpt -%}
At some point in every software project the team will look at a test coverage report. It is at this moment that some 
smart ass will make a comment that one could easily write tests that will execute every line of code without any 
assertions and achieve 100% coverage while verifying nothing about the code. He is only half right. That process will 
not yield any tests that are useful for testing the functionality of the software. Where is he wrong? The writing of 
those tests will not, in any way, be easy.
